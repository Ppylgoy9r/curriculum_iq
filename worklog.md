Task: Fix chart rendering bugs, remove Stream Mapping section, add XLS download feature

Work Log:
- Diagnosed root cause of charts not rendering: AI returns `trendComparison` key but frontend expected `trendMatch`
- Added `normalizeAnalysis()` function to handle both key names and JSON string parsing from DB
- Applied normalization in `handleAnalyze`, `handleViewCurriculum`, and batch upload callback
- Removed "Stream Mapping & Placement Insights" section from Recommendations tab
- Added `handleDownloadXLS()` function generating 5-sheet XLS workbook:
  - Sheet 1: Updated Curriculum (original topics + status + recommended topics inline)
  - Sheet 2: Analysis Summary (scores, metrics)
  - Sheet 3: Trend Comparison (curriculum vs industry by category)
  - Sheet 4: Outdated Topics (topic, reason, week)
  - Sheet 5: Recommended Topics (topic, priority, reason, suggested week)
- Added "Download Analysis (XLS)" button in dashboard header (appears after analysis)
- Added prominent download card in Recommendations tab
- ESLint passed, dev server running

Stage Summary:
- Charts now render correctly with normalized data
- Stream Mapping section removed per user request
- Download XLS feature fully implemented with comprehensive multi-sheet output
